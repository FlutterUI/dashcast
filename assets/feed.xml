                    In everything I do, I believe in creativity and growing into excellence. The way I do this is by creating products and contents that are useful, beautiful and easy to use. I happen to create mobile apps! Currently an Android developer at Farmcrowdy Limited (No. 1 startup in Nigeria). I have 4 years experience developing Android apps, and I'm super excited to be part of the first people to launch an Android and iOS app using flutter in Nigeria.

                    Spanish engineer lost in Chicago. I am the organizer of the Chicago Flutter Meetup. I work for the BMW Group, where we craft the Android apps for BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce. When I am not coding, you’ll likely find me playing guitar, and trying to sing at the same time, although we can all agree that singing is not one of my strengths!
